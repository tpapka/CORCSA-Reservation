Colorado Road and Community Safety Act (CO-RCSA SB251)  Senate Bill 13-251, The Colorado Road and Community Safety Act authorizes the issuance of a Colorado driver license, instruction permit or identification card to those individuals who either cannot demonstrate lawful presence in the U.S. or can only demonstrate temporary lawful presence in the U.S.
